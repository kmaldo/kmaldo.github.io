<h1>Land with suit</h1>


<p>You think it would be much safer to land with the suit just incase the heat it too unbearable. You walk out and feel the overpowering heat of the sun but its just bearable. You quickly look around but see no crystal. You jump back into the spaceship in frustration, <strong>at least you know that you can be closer to the sun</strong></p>
