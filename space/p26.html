<h1>Search around the sun</h1>

<p>Choosing to search around closer to the sun, you put on the heat protection suit that will protect you from a distance from the sun. As you get closer to the sun, it gets extremely hot to the point you even consider going back. You never know what could be near the sun though.</p>
