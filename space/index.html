	</head>
<body>Welcome to the Space Department, I heard you're looking for some crystals that have been rumored to spread around through space. I personally don't believe they exist but some people at the space department are thinking it's real enough to give a reward of $1,000,000,000 if found... oh you already know that? Well, no one has found these rumored crystals, in fact nobody who has gone to search for them has returned at all. Are you sure you want to try to find all three crystals?.... Very well, i'll get the spaceship set up for you. Get ready while you read the precautions in attempt to find the crystals. Good luck, you'll need it.</body>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Your job is to find all three crystals in this order: Yellow, blue, and pink. This is a choice based game where you will choose the paths you're going down in attempt to find the crystals,<strong> here are some tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Some paths will lead directly to a dead end so be careful</li>
	<li>Some paths will give you a hint where the next crystal is so be aware of that</li>
	<li> Don't get lost</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The spaceship is ready.... Good luck!</strong></h3>
