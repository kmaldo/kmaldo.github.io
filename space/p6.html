<h1>The bright light</h1>
<body>As you approach the bright light that seems to be getting closer, you realize its coming in much faster than you thought. Then you realize its a comet coming straight for you, you run as fast as you can on the moon with the lack of gravity making it difficult. The comet passes you and you sigh with relief, then you hear a loud boom. You look over to your spaceship and see it destroyed by the comet. You're stuck, and the only thought that comes to mind is will anyone find me?</body>
