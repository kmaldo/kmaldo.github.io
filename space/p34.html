<h1>The Pink Crystal!</h1>

<p>You take the biggest risk so far and jump out of the spaceship with a rope attached towards the light. You quickly grab the object and almost pass out right there in the middle of space when you quickly whip the rope back into the spaceship and blast the ship off in the other direction. You need a moment to catch your breathe since it was nearly impossible to breathe. You finally take a look at the object and can't believe your eyes. The Pink Crystal! You set it down by the blue and yellow one and the lights conjoin together making it a beautiful sight. You sigh in relief as you make your way home.</p>
