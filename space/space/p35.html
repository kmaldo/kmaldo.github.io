<h1>Congratulations!</h1>

<p>When you arrive at the Space Department, everyone cheers and claps as you hand them all three crystals. A ceremony was held for you as you were given the reward of $1,000,000,000 for your brave efforts. You even get to own the crystals as your own! You have done the greatest thing for the Space Department</p>
