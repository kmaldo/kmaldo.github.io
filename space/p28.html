<h1>Flashing Star</h1>

<br><body>You decided to investigate what the flashing star is. As you get closer to the flashing star, you start to feel like you aren't controlling the ship anymore, like its moving by itself. You're confused as you try to reverse the ship, you look through a telescope and see a black hole where the flashing star was. You panic and run around the ship trying to figure out a way to break free, but it was too late. The black hole gave one big pull and the entire ship was sucked into it</body></br>
